Public Files
============

Any files you place in here will be publicly available on your site
under the root (`/`) path. For instance "favicon.ico" will be publicly
available as http://example.com/favicon.ico etc.

Any CSS stylesheets, Javascript source files or images that you use
should be placed under the "assets" directory where Spontaneous can
manage them using Sprockets' powerful bundling, compression and
fingerprinting functions (see `assets/README.md` for more
information).
