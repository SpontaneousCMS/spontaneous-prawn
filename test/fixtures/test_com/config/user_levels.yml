# User levels

# Feel free to add your own
# the 'root' user level is added automatically and
# will always be higher than any you add here
#
# Similary the 'none' level will always be lower
# The order is important -- later leves are higher levels
#
# Higher levels will always be able to do everything that a lower level can do
#
# Flags:
#
# Flags are set per-level -- higher levels don't inherit the value from lower levels.
#
# - 'publish' defines the particular level's access to the publishing process. The default is false
#
# - 'admin' allows users to administer the site's user accounts. The default is false
